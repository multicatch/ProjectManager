# ProjectManager
A simple project management in .NET Core. Inspired by other project management tools like JIRA, Redmine, etc. 

Really simple, mainly an excercise for me to practice C# (ASP.NET Core) and React. Also uses Autofac for DI and Entity Framework Core for database integration.
Currently it only supports SQLite as it was intended to be a small project.

It was mainly developed with [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and I think it would be most comfortable to view it with.

The React front-end is in the [ClientApp](ProjectManager/ClientApp/) directory.
